# PY-CL-Exception-Handling

## Overview

This project focuses on exception handling in Python. It includes an `app.py` file for demonstrating exception handling in action and a `lab.py` file containing a class called `Lab` which showcases how to raise exceptions.

## Files

### app.py

The `app.py` file demonstrates how to use the `Lab` class and handle exceptions in Python.

### lab.py

The `lab.py` file contains the implementation of the `Lab` class, which demonstrates how to raise exceptions in Python.

### lab_test.py

The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the `Lab` class. It includes test cases to verify the functionality of the `Lab` methods, specifically focusing on exception handling.
